### 🧠 Previous Projects
1. **[Predicting ICU Length of Stay caused by Microbacterial Infection using Bayesian Neural Network](https://github.com/febyhadayani17/icu-length-of-stay-prediction)**  
   - Achieved R-square 58.5% and RMSE 4.3 days using Bayesian Neural Network (which outperformed Bayesian Linear Regression) to predict ICU Length of Stay caused by bacterial infection from MIMIC III & MIMIC IV datasets. Used demographics (marital status, age, gender) and insurance ownership as independent variables.

2. **[Audio Genre Classification using LSTM](https://github.com/febyhadayani17/audio_genre_classification_lstm)**  
   - Achieved 73% accuracy by classifying GTZAN audio dataset into various genres using ResLSTM, which outperformed ConvLSTM & standard LSTM.

3. **[Forecasting US Unemployment Rate in Dec 2024 using Linear Backward Regression](https://github.com/febyhadayani17/forecast_us_unemployment_dec2024)**  
   - Achieved 99% accuracy of US Unemployment Rate prediction by incorporating macroeconomic time series data as independent variables.

4. **[Amazon Groceries Recommendation System using Association Rules](https://github.com/febyhadayani17/amazon_recommendation_system_association_rules)**  
   - Built a recommendation system based on users' last purchased items and recommended products with higher ratings.
